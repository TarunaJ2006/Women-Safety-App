# Mid-Submission Report — Women Safety App

## Project Overview

The Women Safety App is an autonomous, AI-driven system combining real-time computer vision, audio analysis, and emergency response functionality to detect threats and assist users during risky situations. The project leverages **Agentic AI** for intelligent decision-making, automating threat assessment and emergency responses without manual intervention. It includes a React frontend, a FastAPI backend with WebSocket support, multiple CV/ML components (crowd detection, pose estimation, emotion recognition), and an autonomous decision engine that orchestrates multi-modal threat detection.

## Features Implemented (details)

### 1. Agentic AI Automation

**Autonomous Decision-Making Engine**
   - **Multi-Modal Threat Assessment**: Combines vision (crowd density, pose, motion) and audio (emotion, stress detection) inputs to compute a unified threat score.
   - **Risk Scoring Algorithm**: 
     ```
     Threat Score = (Vision Weight × Vision Risk) + 
                    (Audio Weight × Audio Risk) + 
                    (Context Weight × Context Risk)
     ```
   - **Adaptive Response Levels**:
     - Low Threat (<0.3): Silent logging, dashboard updates
     - Medium Threat (0.3-0.7): Vibration alert, evidence collection
     - High Threat (>0.7): Loud alarm, auto-call 112, contact cascade, GPS sharing
   - **Context-Aware Intelligence**: Adjusts sensitivity based on location type, time of day, environmental conditions, and user preferences.

**Automated Emergency Response**
   - Automatic 112 calling with pre-packaged location data and evidence
   - Contact notification cascade (SMS → Call → Email)
   - Real-time GPS location sharing with accuracy radius
   - Evidence collection (blurred snapshots, audio clips, sensor data, timestamps)
   - Multi-channel alert system (sound, vibration, LED flash)

### 2. Real-time Monitoring
   - Continuous streaming from connected cameras
   - Frame preprocessing and batching for YOLO inference
   - Aggregation layer to compute people count and density

### 3. Threat Detection
   - Pose-based risk scoring (MediaPipe) to detect suspicious postures
   - Audio classification to pick up screams, shouts, and distress (7 emotions: Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, Disgust, Fearful, Surprised)
   - Combined decision engine to escalate alerts based on fused evidence

### 4. Emergency Response
   - Countdown auto-trigger to call emergency services
   - Shared location and evidence snapshots to contacts and services
   - Optional face blur and auto-delete policies implemented in settings

### 5. User Experience
   - Mobile-first responsive UI with accessible controls
   - Demo modes to simulate threat scenarios (normal, escalating, critical)
   - Settings with immediate persistence and validation
   - Privacy protection with face blurring and evidence auto-deletion
