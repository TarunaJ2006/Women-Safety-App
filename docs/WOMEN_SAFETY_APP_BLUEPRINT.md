## 🧠 Agentic AI Decision Engine

### Multi-Modal Threat Assessment
1. **Vision-Based Threat Detection**
   - Crowd density analysis (>10 people in confined space)
   - Individual pose risk assessment (hands raised, aggressive gestures)
   - Motion pattern analysis (rapid movement, erratic behavior)
   - Facial expression analysis (fear, anger)

2. **Audio-Based Threat Detection**
   - Speech emotion analysis (fearful, angry, surprised)
   - Audio threat detection (screaming, shouting, breaking sounds)
   - Ambient sound analysis (gunshots, crashes, alarms)
   - Voice stress detection

3. **Contextual Factors**
   - Location type (public space, isolated area)
   - Time of day (night increases risk)
   - Environmental conditions (weather, lighting)
   - User profile and preferences

### Risk Scoring Algorithm
```
Threat Score = (Vision Weight × Vision Risk) + 
               (Audio Weight × Audio Risk) + 
               (Context Weight × Context Risk)

Where:
- Vision Risk: 0-1 scale based on crowd/pose/motion
- Audio Risk: 0-1 scale based on emotion/threats
- Context Risk: 0-1 scale based on environment
- Weights: Adjustable based on user preferences
```

### Adaptive Response Mechanisms
1. **Low Threat (Score < 0.3)**
   - Silent logging
   - Status update on dashboard
   - No user notification

2. **Medium Threat (Score 0.3-0.7)**
   - Visual alert on dashboard
   - Vibration notification
   - Evidence collection initiated

3. **High Threat (Score > 0.7)**
   - Loud audible alarm
   - Emergency contact notification
   - 112 calling initiated
   - Location sharing activated
   - Evidence collection with timestamp

## 🚨 Emergency Response System

### Automatic 112 Integration
```python
# Pseudocode for 112 calling system
def initiate_emergency_call():
    location = get_current_gps()
    threat_data = get_threat_assessment()
    evidence = collect_evidence()
    
    call_data = {
        "location": location,
        "threat_level": threat_data["score"],
        "timestamp": datetime.now(),
        "evidence_files": evidence["files"]
    }
    
    # Initiate 112 call with data
    emergency_service.call_112(call_data)
```

### Contact Notification Cascade
1. **Primary Contacts** (immediate SMS)
2. **Secondary Contacts** (follow-up calls)
3. **Tertiary Contacts** (email notifications)
4. **Backup System** (social media alerts)

### Evidence Collection
- **Visual Evidence**: Blurred face snapshots with timestamp
- **Audio Evidence**: 30-second audio clips before/during threat
- **Location Data**: GPS coordinates with accuracy radius
- **Sensor Data**: Accelerometer, gyroscope readings
- **Metadata**: Device info, battery level, network status
